My name is Xiyang Wu. I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/) and a member of [GAMMA](https://gamma.umd.edu/) group. My research advisor is Prof. [Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha). I hold a Master's degree from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I was working with Prof. [Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). Before that, I earned my Bachelor's in Engineering from [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm), supervised by Prof. [Xiaodong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=as6X3L0AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interest lies in using the reasoning ability of neural networks and Large Language Models in robot decision-making and navigation tasks. Specifically, incorporating Large Language Models with reinforcement learning approaches in multi-agent coordination, scene understanding, and opponents' intention inference when navigating and collaborating under complex and heterogeneous environments.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
