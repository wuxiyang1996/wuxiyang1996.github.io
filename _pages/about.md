My name is Xiyang Wu. I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/) and a member of [GAMMA](https://gamma.umd.edu/) group. My research advisor is Prof. [Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha). I hold a Master's degree from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I was working with Prof. [Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). Before that, I earned my Bachelor's in Engineering from [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm), supervised by Prof. [Xiaodong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=as6X3L0AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interest lies in using the reasoning ability of neural networks and Large Language Models in robot decision-making and navigation tasks. Specifically, incorporating Large Language Models with reinforcement learning approaches in multi-agent coordination, scene understanding, and opponents' intention inference when navigating and collaborating under complex and heterogeneous environments.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
