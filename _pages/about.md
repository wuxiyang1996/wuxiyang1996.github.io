My name is Xiyang Wu. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/) and a member of [GAMMA](https://gamma.umd.edu/) group. My research advisor is Prof. [Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha). I hold a Master's degree from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I was working with Prof. [Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). Before that, I earned my Bachelor's in Engineering from [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm), supervised by Prof. [Xiaodong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=as6X3L0AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on **multi-modal foundation models**, with an emphasis on hallucination detection, mitigation, and physical reasoning under complex, real-world conditions. In parallel, I explore the integration of neural networks and large language models into **robotic decision-making and navigation**, aiming to improve robots’ situational awareness, robustly interpret human behaviors and intentions, and adapt their actions in dynamic, collaborative environments. 

Please check list of publications [here](http://wuxiyang1996.github.io/publications/).

**I am currently on the job market and actively seeking internships and full-time opportunities. If my research aligns with your interests, I would be glad to connect.**
